The Warehouse Manifesto site is now live.

This space will act as a central home for the label, for releases, and for everything that grows out of it over time. The intention is simple. Build something solid, independent, and rooted in the underground techno and electro sound that has shaped my taste for over twenty years.

Warehouse Manifesto is first and foremost a vinyl-focused label project. Physical releases matter to me. The artwork, the object itself, the permanence of it. That is the direction this is moving in, even if it takes time to get there properly.

Alongside releases, the label will also host mixes and podcasts from DJs and selectors whose sound aligns with the ethos. SoundCloud has been an important platform for me over the years, both for sharing my own sets and for connecting with others doing good work. This project is partly about giving something back to that ecosystem.

You’ll see **GAMADON** referenced throughout the site. That is my DJ and live performance alias, and it will continue to sit alongside the label as its own thing. They are connected, but not the same. The site reflects that separation.

Over the coming months there will be new mixes, podcasts, and updates posted here, with links out to the platforms where the music actually lives. This site is not meant to replace those platforms, but to act as a clear point of reference.

Warehouse Manifesto stands for tolerance, acceptance, and kindness. The underground has always worked best when people look out for each other. That principle carries through everything here.

More to follow soon.
