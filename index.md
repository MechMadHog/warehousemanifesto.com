## Warehouse Manifesto

Independent electronic music label.  
Techno and electro. Vinyl focused.

Warehouse Manifesto is a long-term project built around the underground sound I have loved for over twenty years. The goal is to grow the label carefully, with a strong focus on physical releases, artwork, and music that stands the test of time.

Alongside releases, the label will host mixes and podcasts from DJs and selectors whose sound aligns with the ethos. This site acts as a central point of reference for everything connected to the project.

More updates coming soon.

Warehouse Manifesto advocates tolerance, acceptance, and kindness to all.  
The underground works best when people look out for each other.
